# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Provide a single-page, playful minimal UI featuring one clearly labeled button that intentionally does nothing when clicked.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page layout with one visible, English-labeled button.
- Ensure the button click handler performs no action and triggers no side effects (no navigation, state changes, network calls, console output, or dialogs).
- Apply a cohesive playful minimal visual theme (palette, typography, spacing) with consistent button styling and clear hover/focus states, using existing UI components without modifying `frontend/src/components/ui`.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a themed page with a single button that stays enabled and clickable, and clicking it produces no visible or hidden effects.
